Throughout this course, we had the goal of finding the most efficient ways of loading data and sorting it. Our approach to this problem was to test different data structures and sorting techniques to build a base line and see how each one compared. It was important to test different data structures, as they have their own benefits and disadvantages. Somewhere great at accessing randomly, while others were great at native sorting. You need to implement the correct data structure for the correct situation in order to take advantage of what each one has to offer. Roadblocks on this course were very frequent. However, the guided lessons available on YouTube with coding forums such as stack overflow, proved to be more than enough resources to work through the problems. After working through these roadblocks, I now have a deeper understanding of what code optimization means and how it's calculated. Understanding big O notation allows us plan for situations where program runtime could have adverse effects. Additionally, after working through this course I have developed a better understanding of c+By working with the starter code, it gave me a good idea of what layouts should look like, for the next working programmer to easily pick up and begin writing code.de.
